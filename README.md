## Operation Process

1. **Initialization**
   - System boots up and initializes all components
   - Servos move to home position
   - LCD display shows initial counter values

2. **Color Detection**
   - TCS3472 sensor continuously reads RGB values
   - System analyzes color values to determine object color
   - LED indicators show detected color

3. **Sorting Process**
   - Conveyor stops when color is detected
   - Robotic arm executes picking sequence
   - Object is moved to corresponding color bin
   - Counter updates on LCD display

4. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time display of sorted object counts
   - Serial output for debugging
   - LED indicators for visual feedback

## Performance Metrics

- **Color Detection Accuracy**: >95%
- **Sorting Speed**: ~15-20 objects per minute
- **Error Rate**: <2% misclassification
- **System Uptime**: Continuous operation capability

## Maintenance and Calibration

Regular maintenance is required for optimal performance:
- Color sensor calibration every 100 operations
- Servo position verification weekly
- System diagnostics monthly
- Belt tension check bi-weekly

## Future Improvements

1. **Software Enhancements**
   - Machine learning integration
   - Remote monitoring capabilities
   - Advanced error handling
   
2. **Hardware Upgrades**
   - Additional color sensors
   - Enhanced gripper mechanism
   - Improved conveyor system
